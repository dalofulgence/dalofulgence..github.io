                <p>Thank you, dear President Nelson, for that joyful revelatory guidance with 
                    respect to witnesses at baptisms and the direction you have
                     asked us to share to help strengthen youth and develop their sacred potential.

                    Before I share those adjustments, we express our sincere 
                    appreciation for the exceptional way members have responded to 
                    developments in the ongoing Restoration of the gospel. As President 
                    Nelson suggested last year, you have taken your vitamins!1
                    
                    You joyfully study Come, Follow Me at home.2 You have also responded 
                    to adjustments at church. Members of the elders quorum and Relief Society 
                    sisters unitedly do the work of salvation.3
                    It was clear to Israel that Moses spoke for God. God would meet with Moses in the tent of meeting and give him words to say to the people.

                    So when Joshua heard about two men who had prophesied in the camp, 
                    it made sense that he would want to protect Moses’ unique role as 
                    God’s prophet. But Moses responded, “Are you jealous for my sake? 
                    I wish that all the Lord’s people were prophets and that the Lord 
                    would put his Spirit on them!” Moses was not threatened; instead, 
                    he saw what a 
                    blessing it would be if all God’s people would speak for and from God.
                    Moses’ desire was fulfilled centuries later when the Spirit of God came 
                    to God’s people on Pentecost (Acts 2). The prophet Joel had proclaimed that 
                    a day was coming when God’s Spirit would be poured out on all people. And on 
                    Pentecost the crowds of visitors from all nations heard the followers of Jesus 
                    declaring the wonders of God in their own languages. The age of the Spirit had 
                    come because our chief prophet, Jesus, 
                    had provided us salvation and given his followers new life in the Spirit.</p>
